# guide build by rainmanp7[https://github.com/rainmanp7]
You have 2 things which u will do first.
You will compile the daemon 2 times.
1st time you configure the cryptonoteconfig.h file and place a seed node ip address pointing at the 2nd one you will make.
Now u compile that and upload it to the vps you paid for.. you configure the required library's needed and install them on the vps.
Run it...
Next you clean everything up on local computer and this time you change the 2nd build cryptonoteconfig.h
To the first Ip address ,excluding the 1st.
Upload and do the sane library install..
Run it...
Now you have 2 daemons talking synced across.
Everything else will be built with the 2 seeds
At the bottom on the cryptonoteconfig.h
Your wallet and everything else.
I hope this information has helped you.
